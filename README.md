This script looks in the `test/data` directory for PDF files. It then loops through those PDF files, which are just HTML pages saved as PDF files.

*To install:*

`npm install package.json`. It'll install packages into the node_modules folder.

From what I can tell it doesn't use the data/parsed folder. It just creates a bunch of CSVs from the PDF files.
