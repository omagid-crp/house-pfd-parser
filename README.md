This script parses House financial disclosure reports available at http://clerk.house.gov/public_disc/financial-search.aspx. It's a modification of <a href-"https://github.com/PublicI/pfd-parser">this script</a>, created by the Center for Public Integrity, which parses executive branch financial disclosure reports.

It accepts three command line arguments: filePath, outPath, and noContentPath. The filePath is the directory containing PDFs for it to parse. The outPath is the directory where it will save CSVs of the parsed data it produces. The noContentPath is the directory where it will move PDFs with unreadable content. If no arguments are given, filePath defaults to `{current_directory}/data/input/`, outPath defaults to `{current_directory}/data/output/`, and noContentPath defaults to `{current_directory}/data/no-content/`.
